# quip
## Codingbat clone

This is a website aimed at teaching code through short examples. However, `quip` aims to use modern technology (`pyodide`, `monaco`) to provide a smoother experience than the bare-basics approach of codingbat.com. Currently in barely-working-demo phase, will probably use Django eventually.
